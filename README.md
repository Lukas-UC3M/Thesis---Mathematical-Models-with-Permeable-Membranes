This repo contains three scripts that approximate the solution of a sytem od non-linear differential equations using Newton-Raphson Method.
These codes were created as part of my Bachelor Thesis project: "Mathematical Models with Permeable Membranes".

The scripts included are:
  - one_dim.m
  - two_dim.m
  - two_dim_source.m

The first code is used to solve the case of one spatial dimension. 
The last two codes solve the two spatial dimensions case, but in one of them we add a source term into the equation of one of the domains, and in the other it is not added.

In order to use the code it is just needed to modify the parameters of the system of equation, which are represented as variables at the top of the code.
